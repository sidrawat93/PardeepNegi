      <h1>Here are my top favourite places to train!</h1>
<br>
      <p>As a fitness fanatic living in London I can’t help but check out all the studios around town!</p>
      <p>Whilst I believe that fitness can be done anywhere at any time without any equipment, sometimes it is just fun to book yourself into a class at a studio for the experience. A different workout, fresh motivation, fully equipped showers & changing rooms as well as the option of buying a delicious (and usually much needed) post workout smoothie.</p>
      <p>Fancy trying out a studio but not sure what’s on offer? Here’s the low down on my six favourite studios for different classes.</p>
<br>
      <h2>1) CORE COLLECTIVE</h2>
      <p>With two locations (Kensington & Knightsbridge) and a reputation for it’s awesome workouts, it’s no wonder it’s at the top of my list! From a high intensity Lift & Row class through to Pilates, it’s got it all. Lift & Row is my personal favourite as I love the combination of using the rowing machines and weighted floor exercises followed by a killer finisher at the end. So be prepared to sweat - A LOT! </p>
      <p>With stylish decors, friendly trainers and luxurious showers to refresh, I would highly recommend booking yourself into a class to experience it for yourself!</p>
<br>
      <h2>2) KOBOX</h2>
      <p>If you’re after an amazing boxing workout then look no further. With each day split into targeting different body parts, there are a huge variety of classes available throughout the week. Miranda @fitnesswith_mk and Joe @jk_lifestyle_ 's classes are my personal favourites. They both bring so much energy and fun to each session. Miranda focuses on primal functional movements, the way our bodies are designed to move and feel good, and Joe encourages people to focus on their boxing technique to get a more effective workout, whilst also imitating being in an actual fight environment.</p>
<br>
      <h2>3) KXU</h2>
      <p>This is a relatively new studio with a range of classes to suit everyone, from spin to TRX & hot yoga. My personal favourites are ‘The Games’, 'U-cycle' & ‘HIIT and Run’.</p>
      <p><b>'The Games' </b>is a super challenging workout focusing on building strength primarily through compound movements. Think farmer walks, pull ups, tire flips, SkiErg and battle ropes. Each instructor delivers the class slightly differently but the vibe is always great with everyone supporting each other. </p>
      <p><b>‘HIIT and Run’</b>is more of a mixture of cardio & weights.  You start on the treadmill and sprint it out, gradually increasing speed and incline. Between each round there are a series of strength-based exercises to complete before getting back on the treadmill and stepping the intensity up yet another notch. If you’re looking for a challenge and a good sweaty session then you’ve found your match!</p>
      <p>Their<b>'U-cycle'</u>spin class is like no other – Alex @chelseafitnessclub knows how to get everyone’s energy up and giving their absolute all, leaving just enough behind to hit ‘beast mode’ at the end! The tunes are blasting, disco lights are on and it’s an awesome way to kick start the day. If you’re the competitive type then you’ve also got the leader board for that extra bit of motivation!</p>
<br>
      <h2>4) HEARTCORE </h2>
      <p>Whilst Pilates is perceived to be a relatively relaxed and slow paced class by some, if you’re looking to take it up a notch then try a reformer Pilates class at Heartcore and you may just be surprised! Targeting the whole body with particular attention to the core and glutes you’ll be hobbling out of there by the end! An amazing workout showing how little isolated movements can have such a big impact. They have a range of locations which are all beautifully decorated and you’re always welcomed by super friendly instructors.</p>
<br>
      <h2>5) SWEAT IT</h2>
      <p>This up-and-coming studio was more recently brought to my attention after I won their Instagram competition for a bundle of 5 free classes (and Plenish milk & Innermost protein powder!). So, naturally I couldn’t wait to have a look at their schedule and book myself in! The first session I booked onto was their <b>‘Machine Guns’</b>, targeting shoulders, triceps and biceps in between sprints on their super snazzy treadmills.</p>
      <p>My experience was off to a great start walking into the studio – a quirky but cool interior, bubbly staff and a whole list of delicious sounding post workout shakes to choose from!</p>
      <p>A super tough but fun workout left me feeling exhausted but on such a high. The combination of exercises on the rig cleverly work the upper body muscle groups and are broken up by pretty brutal treadmill drills – think sprints on an incline, parachute ‘dead tread’ mode and mountain climbers (yes, on the treadmill!).</p>
      <p>My second class was their new and infamous <b>‘Guts & Glory’</b> class , which does just as it says on the tin. Circuits, AMRAPS & heaving compound lifts are all involved!</p>
      <p><b>'Compound 60'</b> was my third class, which is their whole-body weekend workout. Expect to give your all - between the circuit style workout and treadmill you'll be left exhausted but exhilarated! It's safe to say I can't wait to go back for my last two classes.</p>
<br>
      <h2>6) LONDON TRACK LIFE & ONE-TRACK CLUB</h2>
      <p>Are you a runner or looking to spark your interest? Now while I admit these are not studios, they are honestly two of the best workouts I have done and I’m so grateful to have them as my local run clubs! They’re both great ways not only to get involved in a running club but also to make friends who have similar interests and support each other. Tracklife is located on the Battersea Park track and costs £10 whereas One Track is on Duke of York Square track in Chelsea, is run by KXU and is free! Sadly both are on a Monday evening at the same time so I have had to alternate between the two. Both provide an amazing workout by very educated and dedicated coaches. You’ll be pushed to deliver your best performance but people of all abilities are welcome and looked after. An amazing atmosphere which leaves you wanting to come back for more – even when you leave utterly exhausted!</p>
      <br>
      <p>I hope this has been useful and given you an insight into some new studios and classes around London. Please let me know if you try any and happy sweating!! </p>
